6.6 References

 

**6.1 Earth Axis Systems** (ref 6.6.1)

Both fixed-Earth and moving-Earth axis systems keep constant *orientation* with respect to the Earth. The Z-axis point towards the center of the Earth.

• The origin of a fixed-Earth system does not move relative to the Earth. (such as a ground radar site)

• The origin of a moving Earth system does not move relative to its host (such as an aircraft inertial reference unit) .
