Although individual organizations generally are consistent in-house, confusion often arises when trying to mathematically translate inputs &amp; deflections from one organization to another. This section documents the generally accepted “body axes” sign conventions then discusses the rationale for several viewpoints addressing the “inputs &amp; deflections” debate. Below is the SFTE sign convention. Wind Axes Sign Convention Winds are listed according to the direction they are coming from. Airports refer winds to magnetic North while winds at altitude are typically referred to true North. Headwind is true airspeed minus ground speed. (Vw=VT-Vg). Body Axes Sign Convention The generally accepted body axes sign convention is based on the establishment of a three-dimensional axis system with the following properties: 1. It is right-handed orthogonal 2. Its origin is at the vehicle's reference center of gravity (defined by builder). 3. The axis system moves with the airframe. Translational displacements, rates, accelerations, &amp; forces are positive along the positive body axes directions. In spite of the simplicity of this logic, it is important to recognize that lift and normal load factor are positive in the negative z direction and the drag is positive in the negative x direction. Angular displacements, rates, accelerations &amp; moments, are positive according to the “right hand rule” (a clockwise rotation while looking in the direction of the positive axis) as shown in the figure. The body axes, forces &amp; translations along them, and moments &amp; rotations about them are shown with arrows indicating the positive direction. Angular displacements, rates, accelerations &amp; moments, are positive according to the “right hand rule” (a clockwise rotation while looking in the direction of the positive axis) as shown in the figure. The body axes, forces &amp; translations along them, and moments &amp; rotations about them are shown with arrows indicating the positive direction. Angle of attack is positive clockwise from the projection of the velocity vector on the xz plane to the reference x body axis. The angle of sideslip is positive clockwise from the xz plane to the velocity vector (wind in the pilot’s right ear). Aircraft true heading is the angle between true North and the projection of the x-body axis onto the horizontal plane. Mag. heading refers to mag North The velocity vector is measured relative to the air mass while the flightpath is measured relative to the ground. They are equivalent only when winds are zero. Flightpath heading angle (ground track heading) σg, is the horizontal angle between true North and the projection of the flightpath on the horizontal plane. Positive rotation is from north to east. € Flightpath elevation angle; γ, is the vertical angle between the flightpath and the horizontal plane. Positive rotation is up. During a descent, this parameter is commonly known as glide path angle. Flightpath bank angle; \\(\\mu\\), is the angle between the plane formed by the velocity vector and the lift vector and the vertical plane containing the velocity vector. Positive rotation is clockwise about the velocity vector, looking forward. Fuselage reference station (FRS), Water line (WL), and Buttock line (BL) are reference coordinates established by the design group.

From the body axis convention above, flight testers recognize that a climbing right turn generates positive angular measurements. Logically then, pull, right roll and right yaw pilot inputs and subsequent surface deflections should also be positive. The traditional flight tester’s convention follows as “All input forces &amp; displacements, surface deflections, and motions that cause a climbing right turn are positive.” Due to differential nature of aileron deflections, they require more discussion. The flight tester’s logic implies (but does not dictate) positive deflections are right aileron up and left aileron down. It is, however, equally acceptable to assign downward (or upward) deflection as positive for both ailerons and calculate the difference between the two as a measure of rolling moment. The rationale within the wind tunnel community is also logical: any control surface deflection that increases lift is positive. From this, positive deflections are trailing edge down (TED) for each: trailing edge flap, stabilizer, elevator, stabilator, rollervator, ruddervator, canard, aileron, flaperon, and all their tabs. Leading edge flap down is also positive. Similarly, since side force is positive to the right, then positive rudder and rudder tab deflections are trailing left (TEL). The only exception to this straightforward logic is for spoilers and speed brakes that extend only in one direction: this deflection is positive even though it might decrease the lift. Since the above rationale defines downward deflection as positive for both ailerons, a measurement of rolling moments requires calculation of the differential aileron deflection. This rationale does not, however, specifically dictate whether a “positive” differential deflection should generate right wing down (RWD) or left wing down (LWD) moments. Differential aileron can be calculated as either. \\(\\delta_{a} = \\frac{\\delta_{\\text{aR}} - \\delta_{\\text{aL}}}{2}\\) or \\(\\delta_{a} = \\frac{\\delta_{\\text{aL}} - \\delta_{\\text{aR}}}{2}\\) Selection of the RWD convention is obvious from the flight tester’s viewpoint since deflections that generate right rolls are positive. An alternative interpretation is that a positive differential aileron deflection is one that lifts the positive (right) wing lifts more than the left (LWD). Another common convention for ailerons is one that gives the same sign to both ailerons for any input. The “right hand screw” convention is opposite to the flight tester’s convention, but may be more common: δaR = +TED, δaL = +TEU. The above wind tunnel rationale dictates only the polarity for individual control surface deflections, and leaves open the sign convention debate about controller (inceptor) input forces &amp; displacements. One approach is that positive inputs should generate positive motions while an alternate approach is that positive inputs generate positive surface deflections. Only the flight tester’s convention states that positive inputs yield positive motions and deflections. All approaches are mathematically connected to the hinge moment sign convention discussed below. The simplest control surface hinge moment convention is that all positive hinge moments (generated by the pilot and the aerodynamics) move the surface in a positive direction, i.e., positive input forces yield positive deflections. This has different implications for the different sign conventions: • According to the above flight tester’s sign convention, a positive pull force is required to generate a positive (TEU) elevator deflection (positive stick force generates a climb). • According to wind tunnel sign convention, a positive push force is required to generate a positive (TED) elevator deflection (positive stick force generates a dive). The alternate viewpoint defines a positive inceptor hinge moment as one that opposes the aerodynamic moments. In other words, a positive inceptor hinge moment moves the surface to a position which generates positive aerodynamic hinge moments or “positive input forces &amp; displacements generate negative surface deflections.” Based on the above background, the SFTE technical council proposes the following standard convention for inceptor &amp; surface forces &amp; deflections: • Due to its widespread use and its simple &amp; robust nature, use the wind tunnel convention for control surface deflections. • Due to widespread test pilot &amp; FTE familiarity and logical nature, use the flight tester’s convention that positive inceptor forces &amp; displacements generate a climbing right turn. • A fallout from these conventions is that positive inceptor hinge moments generate positive aerodynamic hinge moments (negative surface deflections). • Consistent use of the above logic requires that the calculated value for aileron deflection be negative for right wing down moments. Similarly, differential ruddervator deflections generating nose right yawing moments should have negative values.

Historically, Dutch, U.S. and some British aircraft use a climbing right turn, while it is a diving left turn for Canadian, Australian, and some British aircraft. The SFTE Technical Council recognizes that several combinations of the above possibilities are currently in use around the world, and invites comments, additions, or corrections to the above summary and proposal. Although SFTE does not expect all organizations to adopt this standard, it still provides a cornerstone for reference purposes 1.7 Thermodynamics Relations (references 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6) 1.7.1 Thermodynamic Definitions A Process is an event with a redistribution of energy within a system. A Reversible process is one that can be reversed such that the system returns to its original state (form, location &amp; amount). An Irreversible process cannot return to its original state due to heat flow from higher to lower temperatures, fluid turbulence, friction, or inelastic deformation. The change in entropy is non-zero. An Isothermal process is one in which the temperature of the fluid is constant. An Adiabatic process is one in which heat is not transferred to or from the fluid. Work is the energy transfer by way of changing mechanical energy. Heat is the energy transfer from one body to another by virtue of a temperature difference between them. An Isentropic process has constant entropy. Conduction is the energy transfer from a warmer body by tangible contact (transfer of some internal molecular kinetic energy). Convection is the repositioning the energy of a fluid without state changes or energy transformations (e.g. heated air moving from one room to another room). Radiation is the energy transmission through space. 1.7.2 Thermodynamic Symbols Symbol Use \\(A\\) area \\(C\\) compressibility factor \\(c\\) speed of sound \\(E = u\\) specific internal energy (e.g. Btu/lb) \\(H\\) specific enthalpy (e.g. Btu/lb) \\(J\\) Joule \\(Q\\) energy supplied to a system or region as heat (e.g. Btu/lb) \\(P\\) absolute pressure (e.g. lbs/ft2) \\(V\\) specific volume (e.g. ft3/lb) \\(W\\) work (+ if entering) \\(\\overline{V}\\) velocity \\(\\Delta\\) change ( final - initial value) \\(Z\\) altitude \\(S\\) specific entropy \\(R\\) gas constant for each gas (for air = 287 J/kg/K = 53.35 ft-lb/lbmR) \\(\\overline{R}\\) universal gas constant = 8.314 kJ/kmol/K = 1545 ft lb/lbmol/R \\(M\\) molar mass (for air = 28.97 kg/kmol) \\(N\\) number of moles \\(\\rho\\) density 1.7.3 Thermodynamic Laws The First Law of Thermodynamics shows that the net amount of energy added to a system equals the net change in energy within the system (Principle of Conservation of Energy): \\(W + Q = (E_2 - E_1)\\) The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy increases during any irreversible process: \\(S_2 &gt; S_1\\) Ideal Gas Equation of State (a.k.a.

That is, for any matrix \\[*A*\\]: \\[*I*\\]\\[*A*\\] = \\[*A*\\]\\[*I*\\] = \\[*A*\\] The identity \\[*I*\\] is a square matrix consisting of ones on the principle diagonal and zeros everywhere else; i.e.: a ⋅ α−1 = α1−1 = α0 = 1 In the same way, the matrix \\[*A*\\]-1 is called the inverse matrix of \\[*A*\\] since: \\[*A*\\]\\[*A*\\]-1 = \\[*A*\\]-1\\[*A*\\] = \\[*A*\\]0 = \\[*I*\\] Cofactors and Determinates The signed minor, with the sign determined by the sum of the row and column, is called the cofactor of aij and is denoted by: Aij = (−1)i+j Μij The value of the determinant is equal to the sum of the products of the elements of any single row or column and their respective cofactors. Arbitrarily expanding about the first row of a 3 x 3 matrix gives the determinant: |A| = a11A11 + a12A12 + a13A13 = which expands to give the final solution: |A| = a11(a22 a33 − a23 a32) − a12(a21 a33 − a23 a31) + a13(a21 a32 − a22 a31) There is a straightforward four-step method for computing the inverse of a given matrix \\[*A*\\]: Step 1 Compute the determinant of \\[*A*\\]. This determinant is written |A|. If the determinant is zero or does not exist, the matrix \\[*A*\\] is defined as singular and an inverse cannot be found. Step 2 Transpose matrix \\[*A*\\]. The resultant matrix is written \\[*A*\\]T. Step 3 Replace each element aij of the transposed matrix by its cofactor Aij. This resulting matrix is defined as the adjoint of matrix \\[*A*\\] and is written Adj\\[*A*\\]. Step 4 Divide the adjoint matrix by the scalar value of the determinant of \\[*A*\\] which was computed in Step 1. The resulting matrix is the inverse and is written \\[*A*\\]-1. Example: Given the following set of simultaneous equations, solve for x1, x2, and x3. 3x1 + 2x2 − 2x3 = y1 − x1 + x2 + 4x3 = y2 2x1 − 3x2 + 4x3 = y3 This set of equations can be written as: \\[*A*\\] \\[*x*\\] = \\[*y*\\] and solved as follows: \\[*x*\\] = \\[*A*\\]−1 \\[*y*\\] Thus, the system can be solved for the values of x1, x2, and x3 by computing the inverse of \\[*A*\\]. Step 1. Compute the determinant of \\[*A*\\]. Expanding about the first row |A| = 3(4 + 12) − 2 (−4 −8) −2 (3 − 2) |A| = 48 + 24 −2 = 70 Step 2. Transpose \\[*A*\\]. Step 3. Determine the adjoint matrix by replacing each element in \\[*A*\\]T by its Cofactor. Step 4. Divide by the scalar value of the determinant of \\[*A*\\] which was computed as 70 in Step 1. if y1 = 1, y2 = 13, and y3 = 8 Cramer’s Rule Given matrices A{x} = {b} If the det (D) of a matrix (A) exists, and Dr is the det of the matrix obtained from A by replacing the rth column of A by the column {b}, then the solution to (1) is xr = Dr/D r = 1,2,…,n Example of Cramer’s Rule Section 2.5 VectorAlgebra (reference 2.5) Addition .

Motion of a point using two reference systems. Reference A can be considered the inertial frame while Rotation of the B reference relative to the A reference must be considered when observing motion wrt the A reference system. Note: Unit vectors are along the B system axes. Subscripts denote reference system. Reference B can be equivalent to a maneuvering aircraft. The velocities of the particle P relative to the A and to the B references are, respectively: These velocities can be related by noting that: Differentiating with respect to time for the A reference, The term is the “transport velocity” and is the only velocity if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. where is the centripetal acceleration, is the Coriolis acceleration, and is the transport acceleration and is the only acceleration if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. To get acceleration wrt A, differentiate: where is the centripetal acceleration, is the Coriolis acceleration, and is the transport acceleration and is the only acceleration if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. Motion of a point using one reference system. Reference A can be considered the inertial frame while The body can be equivalent to a maneuvering aircraft. Section 2.6 Statistics (reference 2.6) Definitions: Population: The set of all possible observations Sample: Any subset of a population Homogeneous Sample: The sample comes from 1 population only Random Sample: Equal probability of selecting any member of the population Independence (of events A and B): P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B) Sample and Population Mean (Average value): Mode (Most commonly occurring value in a sample) Median (middle value, 50th percentile. Half of the sample values are greater and half are smaller) Deviation (from the mean value): Population Variance (from the mean value): Population Standard Deviation (from the mean value): Sample Standard Deviation (from the mean value): Discrete Probability Distributions: Binomial: N independent events, each having probability p of success, and1-p of failure. For example, tossing a fair coin N times where p = the probability of getting a head on any toss. If the random variable x indicates the number of heads in N=2 tosses, then P(x=0) = 1/4, P(x=1) = 1/2, P(x=2) = 1/4. If N=4, then the probabilities are illus trated in the following graph: As N approaches infinity ... So, the binomial distribution is the discrete case of the Normal distribution. Continuous Distributions: As the number of samples increases and the width of the Discrete sample intervals shrink to zero, discrete distributions become continuous. P(x=X) = 0 Must talk about intervals, e.g. P(a &lt; x &lt; b) The Normal Distribution: Normal Distribution: The Standard Normal Distribution: Error Probable: An error budget that would contain half of the population data points. Assumes that events are independent and identically distributed (iid). Also assumes N is large (greater than 30), or population is normally distributed. Circular Error Probable – the 2 Dimensional Case (X error and Y error): Confidence Intervals: In practice, we take a sample from population. The sample mean and variance will differ from the population mean and variance. Confidence Intervals express how certain we are that the population statistics lie in a region around the sample statistics. Central Limit Theorem: Given a population Normally distributed, then the distribution of successive sample means from samples of n observations Approaches a Normal distribution with parameters We want 1- level of confidence that a region around our sample mean value contains the actual population mean. If n &lt; 30, we must use Student’s T Distribution instead of the Standard Normal Determining Sample Size: For the population mean to fall into an interval defined by Where is the accuracy desired (or the error that can be tolerated). Since the sample size decision must be made prior to the test, an estimate must be made for the population standard deviation. Using the estimate we can solve for N Hypothesis Testing: Begins with an assumption (hypothesis), usually about the underlying population distribution of some measured quantity or computed error. Select values for the hypothesis and alternate hypothesis(es) that partition the sample space. Collect N samples of the population test statistic or parameter. There are two types of errors: Type 1 errors reject the hypothesis when it is true; Type II accept the hypothesis when in is false. Large Samples, Unknown Variance use: for Small Samples, Unknown Variance use: Adjusting and Adjust the size of the Error we wish to Detect Change the sample size n 2.7 Standard Series (reference 2.4) Taylor’s Maclaurin’s (Taylor series with a = 0 ): Binomial: Exponential: Logarithmic: Trigonometric: Section 2.8 Derivative Table (references 2.2, 2.3) \\[*x* is the independent variable; *u* and *v* are dependent on *x; w* is dependent on *u; a* and *n* are constants; *log* is common logarithm; *ln* is logarithm to the base *e*\\] Section 2.9 Integral Table (references 2.2, 2.3) x is any variable, u is any function of x, a &amp; b are arbitrary constants.
