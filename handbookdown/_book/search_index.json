Multiplication is not defined for other matrices. \\[*A*\\]\\[*B*\\] = \\[*C*\\] \\[*a~im~*\\]\\[*b~mj~*\\] = \\[*c~ij~*\\] The product of a pair of, 2 × 2 matrices is: The identity (or unit) matrix \\[*I*\\] occupies the same position in matrix algebra that the value of unity does in ordinary algebra. That is, for any matrix \\[*A*\\]: \\[*I*\\]\\[*A*\\] = \\[*A*\\]\\[*I*\\] = \\[*A*\\] The identity \\[*I*\\] is a square matrix consisting of ones on the principle diagonal and zeros everywhere else; i.e.: a ⋅ α^{-1} = α^{1-1} = α^{0} = 1 In the same way, the matrix \\[*A*\\]^{-1} is called the inverse matrix of \\[*A*\\] since: \\[*A*\\]\\[*A*\\]^{-1} = \\[*A*\\]^{-1} \\[*A*\\] = \\[*A*\\]^{0} = \\[*I*\\] Cofactors and Determinates The signed minor, with the sign determined by the sum of the row and column, is called the cofactor of aij and is denoted by: Aij = (−1)i+j Μij The value of the determinant is equal to the sum of the products of the elements of any single row or column and their respective cofactors. Arbitrarily expanding about the first row of a 3 x 3 matrix gives the determinant: |A| = a11A11 + a12A12 + a13A13 = which expands to give the final solution: |A| = a11(a22 a33 − a23 a32) − a12(a21 a33 − a23 a31) + a13(a21 a32 − a22 a31) There is a straightforward four-step method for computing the inverse of a given matrix \\[*A*\\]: Step 1 Compute the determinant of \\[*A*\\]. This determinant is written |A|. If the determinant is zero or does not exist, the matrix \\[*A*\\] is defined as singular and an inverse cannot be found. Step 2 Transpose matrix \\[*A*\\]. The resultant matrix is written \\[*A*\\]^T . Step 3 Replace each element aij of the transposed matrix by its cofactor Aij. This resulting matrix is defined as the adjoint of matrix \\[*A*\\] and is written Adj\\[*A*\\]. Step 4 Divide the adjoint matrix by the scalar value of the determinant of \\[*A*\\] which was computed in Step 1. The resulting matrix is the inverse and is written \\[*A*\\]^{-1} . Example: Given the following set of simultaneous equations, solve for x1, x2, and x3. 3x1 + 2x2 − 2x3 = y1 − x1 + x2 + 4x3 = y2 2x1 − 3x2 + 4x3 = y3 This set of equations can be written as: \\[*A*\\] \\[*x*\\] = \\[*y*\\] and solved as follows: \\[*x*\\] = \\[*A*\\]^{-1} \\[*y*\\] Thus, the system can be solved for the values of x1, x2, and x3 by computing the inverse of \\[*A*\\]. Step 1. Compute the determinant of \\[*A*\\]. Expanding about the first row |A| = 3(4 + 12) − 2 (−4 −8) −2 (3 − 2) |A| = 48 + 24 −2 = 70 Step 2. Transpose \\[*A*\\]. Step 3. Determine the adjoint matrix by replacing each element in \\[*A*\\]^T by its Cofactor. Step 4. Divide by the scalar value of the determinant of \\[*A*\\] which was computed as 70 in Step 1. if y1 = 1, y2 = 13, and y3 = 8 Cramer’s Rule Given matrices A{x} = {b} If the det (D) of a matrix (A) exists, and Dr is the det of the matrix obtained from A by replacing the rth column of A by the column {b}, then the solution to (1) is xr = Dr/D r = 1,2,…,n Example of Cramer’s Rule Section 2.5 VectorAlgebra (reference 2.5) Addition .

Motion of a point using two reference systems. Reference A can be considered the inertial frame while Rotation of the B reference relative to the A reference must be considered when observing motion wrt the A reference system. Note: Unit vectors are along the B system axes. Subscripts denote reference system. Reference B can be equivalent to a maneuvering aircraft. The velocities of the particle P relative to the A and to the B references are, respectively: These velocities can be related by noting that: Differentiating with respect to time for the A reference, The term is the “transport velocity” and is the only velocity if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. where is the centripetal acceleration, is the Coriolis acceleration, and is the transport acceleration and is the only acceleration if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. To get acceleration wrt A, differentiate: where is the centripetal acceleration, is the Coriolis acceleration, and is the transport acceleration and is the only acceleration if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. Motion of a point using one reference system. Reference A can be considered the inertial frame while The body can be equivalent to a maneuvering aircraft. Section 2.6 Probability and Statistics (reference 2.6) #raw Definitions: Population: The set of all possible observations Sample: Any subset of a population Homogeneous Sample: The sample comes from 1 population only Random Sample: Equal probability of selecting any member of the population Independence (of events A and B): P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B) Sample and Population Mean (Average value): \\[\\mu = \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N{x_i} \\] Mode (Most commonly occurring value in a sample) Median (middle value, 50th percentile. Half of the sample values are greater and half are smaller) Deviation: \\[d_i = x_i - \\bar{x} \\] Population Variance: \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \\bar{x}})^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N{d_i^2}\\] Population Standard Deviation (square root of variance): \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \\bar{x}})^2} \\] Sample Standard Deviation: \\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \\bar{x}})^2} \\] Discrete Probability Distributions: ****Binomial:**** N independent events, each having probability p of success, and1-p of failure. For example, tossing a fair coin N times where p = the probability of getting a head on any toss. If the random variable x indicates the number of heads in N=2 tosses, then P(x=0) = 1/4, P(x=1) = 1/2, P(x=2) = 1/4. If N=4, then the probabilities are illus trated in the following graph: As N approaches infinity ... So, the binomial distribution is the discrete case of the Normal distribution. Continuous Distributions: As the number of samples increases and the width of the Discrete sample intervals shrink to zero, discrete distributions become continuous. P(x=X) = 0 Must talk about intervals, e.g. P(a &lt; x &lt; b) The Normal Distribution: Normal Distribution: The Standard Normal Distribution: Error Probable: An error budget that would contain half of the population data points. Assumes that events are independent and identically distributed (iid). Also assumes N is large (greater than 30), or population is normally distributed. Circular Error Probable – the 2 Dimensional Case (X error and Y error): Confidence Intervals: In practice, we take a sample from population. The sample mean and variance will differ from the population mean and variance. Confidence Intervals express how certain we are that the population statistics lie in a region around the sample statistics. Central Limit Theorem: Given a population Normally distributed, then the distribution of successive sample means from samples of n observations Approaches a Normal distribution with parameters We want 1- level of confidence that a region around our sample mean value contains the actual population mean. If n &lt; 30, we must use Student’s T Distribution instead of the Standard Normal Determining Sample Size: For the population mean to fall into an interval defined by Where is the accuracy desired (or the error that can be tolerated). Since the sample size decision must be made prior to the test, an estimate must be made for the population standard deviation. Using the estimate we can solve for N Hypothesis Testing: Begins with an assumption (hypothesis), usually about the underlying population distribution of some measured quantity or computed error. Select values for the hypothesis and alternate hypothesis(es) that partition the sample space. Collect N samples of the population test statistic or parameter. There are two types of errors: Type 1 errors reject the hypothesis when it is true; Type II accept the hypothesis when in is false. Large Samples, Unknown Variance use: for Small Samples, Unknown Variance use: Adjusting and Adjust the size of the Error we wish to Detect Change the sample size n 2.7 Standard Series (reference 2.4) Taylor’s Maclaurin’s (Taylor series with a = 0 ): Binomial: Exponential: Logarithmic: Trigonometric: Section 2.8 Derivative Table (references 2.2, 2.3) \\[*x* is the independent variable; *u* and *v* are dependent on *x; w* is dependent on *u; a* and *n* are constants; *log* is common logarithm; *ln* is logarithm to the base *e*\\] Section 2.9 Integral Table (references 2.2, 2.3) x is any variable, u is any function of x, a &amp; b are arbitrary constants.
